Requirements

* You must have at least PHP version 5.5 installed on your system.


Installation
------------

1. Make sure that the directory `cache/` is writable.

     Example: `$ chmod 0777 cache/` or `$ chown www-data cache/`

2. Execute `install.sql` in your database.

3. Copy the file `config.yml.dist` and rename it to `config.yml` and adapt the new file according to your needs.

4. Copy the file `websites/default/settings.yml.dist` and rename it to `settings.yml` and adapt the new file according to your needs.

5. Create your first module. Let's call it `vendor/start` and use it as our frontpage. This can be done in `settings.yml`.

6. Copy the file `websites/default/site.yml.dist` and rename it to `site.yml`. To use more modules you can register them there.
